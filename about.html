      <h2>Our Value</h2>
      <p>
        We provide clean and safe drinking water to children and women in need that changes everything—health, education, and economic growth. Unlike other organizations that just ask for donations, charity: water educates about the global water crisis so the next generation proactively leads direct actions with us.
      </p>
      <h2 style="margin-top:32px;">Why It Matters</h2>
      <p><strong>Health:</strong> Clean water prevents deadly diseases, giving children a chance to grow up strong and healthy.</p>
      <p><strong>Education:</strong> Girls no longer miss school fetching water—unlocking brighter futures for entire communities.</p>
      <p><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Water access empowers women and communities to build better livelihoods and futures.</p>
